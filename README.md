# Maximize-Matrix-Chain-Multiplication-DP

<h3>
  This function maximized the possible outcome for a chain matrix multiplication, this algorithm can be understand by understanding the logic of the Goldbole's algorithm to optimize the outcome, in this case we are trying to get the greatest possible outcome using Dynamic Programming.
</h3>

<h4>
 This algorithm was developed to solve the problem "Burst Balloons' in LeetCode
